> If README is not readable, nothing else will be.

Too often we find a great project, but give up 5 minutes later only because we can't get enough information from its `README`. I wouldn't blame the developers for the poor `README` readability because, first, unlike the code, there has never been a focus on `README` readability, and second, there is no good tools to enforce `README` readability.

The `readable-readme` project aim to build a GitHub action that checks the readability of `README` files and generate reports to help improve it.
