# Bad writing 1

> I simply searched "bad writing" on Google and got this.

## Here is what I got.

I hate wet and reiny days. It rained a lot in 1816....
a lot - like everyday; the weather in Europe was abnormally
wet because it rained in Switzerland on 130 out of the 183 days
from April to September. If I was Mary Shelley I might decide
to write a book too. Afterall, it was the onnly thing you could
do without TV or anything. She said that she "passed the summer
of 1816 in the environs of Geneva...we occasionally amused
ourselves with some German stories of ghosts... These tales
excited in us a playful desire of imitation"  So, people were
stuck inside and bored. Mary Shelley decided to write a book
becuase it was so awful outside. I can totally see her point,
you know? I guess I would write a novel if there was nothing
else to do.

## Thoughts

Hmmm... This is really bad.
