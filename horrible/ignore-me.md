# This readme should be ignored.

Just to make it obvious that this file is ignored no matter what, I will put a bunch of horrible writing here in case
that it is only ignored because there is nothing to fix.

Take this year’s winner: “For the first month of Ricardo and Felicity's affair, they greeted one another at every stolen
rendezvous with a kiss -- a lengthy, ravenous kiss, Ricardo lapping and sucking at Felicity's mouth as if she were a giant
cage-mounted water bottle and he were the world's thirstiest gerbil” by “Molly Ringle” (nom de plume) of Seattle. The analogy
here does capture the passion of the lovers but while suggesting a ludicrous image, likening an ardent lover to a rodent,
hardly erotic, much less romantic. Furthermore, it suggests a one-sided relationship: Felicity passively exists to slake Ricardo’s
thirst. Actually, this calls to mind Plato’s observation: “As wolves loves sheep, so lovers love their loves.” Wait, maybe it’s
not so bad after all.

There are so many. Where do I start? Okay, take Mariann Simms's winner from 2004: They had but one last remaining night together,
so they embraced each other as tightly as that two-flavor entwined string cheese that is orange and yellowish-white, the orange
probably being a bland Cheddar and the white . . . Mozzarella, although it could possibly be Provolone or just plain American, as
it really doesn't taste distinctly dissimilar from the orange, yet they would have you believe it does by coloring it differently.
